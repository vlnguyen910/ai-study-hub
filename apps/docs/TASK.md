# AI Study Hub - Next Tasks

Updated: 2026-06-12

## Current Position

The project is currently in **Phase 4 completion / Admin MVP hardening readiness**.

- API auth/account/subject/document metadata is mostly implemented.
- Admin-only API controller ownership has been split into `AdminModule` while keeping current `/accounts` and `/subjects` route contracts.
- Web document, Admin dashboard summary, Admin Users, and moderator review flows use real APIs; Admin settings remains UI-only/deferred because no settings API exists yet.
- Mobile auth now has token persistence, refresh retry, and forgot/reset password flow; several document/profile/moderator screens still remain template/mock.
- Dedicated moderation approve/reject endpoints are implemented.
- File upload/download and AI/RAG phases are not ready to start yet.

## Priority 0 - Spec and Contract Cleanup

- [x] Update `apps/docs/SPEC.md` to match the current codebase.
- [x] Decide and document the Web auth token strategy: use hybrid cookie access-token behavior with refresh token stored client-side for refresh requests.
- [x] Decide Admin account update/delete contract: Admin can create/list/detail/ban accounts for MVP. `PATCH /accounts/:id` and `DELETE /accounts/:id` remain user self-service routes.
- [x] Decide document visibility/status transition: private -> public should move to `PENDING` and require review.

## Priority 1 - Finish Phase 3 Product Integration

- [x] Implement document publication transition: changing a private document to public should set status to `PENDING`.
- [x] Web public library: ensure all visible document lists/details use real `GET /documents` and `GET /documents/:id`.
- [x] Web My Documents: replace local mock data with `GET /documents/me`.
- [x] Web document upload: submit metadata through `POST /documents`.
- [x] Web document edit/delete: call `PATCH /documents/:id` and `DELETE /documents/:id`.
- [x] Mobile documents: add list/detail/update/delete service methods for the current Documents API.
- [x] Mobile documents: connect list/detail/upload screens to real services where backend support exists.
- [x] Add focused Web/Mobile service tests for document API clients.

## Priority 2 - Implement Phase 4 Moderation Workflow

- [x] Add backend endpoint to approve a pending document.
- [x] Add backend endpoint to reject a pending document with `rejectionReason`.
- [x] Restrict approve/reject actions to `MODERATOR` and `ADMIN`.
- [x] On approve, set:
  - `status = ACTIVE`
  - `reviewedById`
  - `reviewedAt`
- [x] On reject, set:
  - `status = REJECTED`
  - `reviewedById`
  - `reviewedAt`
  - `rejectionReason`
- [x] Add tests for approve/reject success, forbidden users, invalid status transitions and visibility after approval/rejection.
- [x] Connect Web Moderator documents list to `GET /documents?status=PENDING`.
- [x] Connect Web Moderator detail page to `GET /documents/:id`.
- [x] Connect Web Moderator approve/reject buttons to the new API endpoints.

## Priority 3 - Admin MVP Hardening

- [x] Add auth route, checking token if role = MODERATOR redirect to moderator page and if role = ADMIN redirect to admin page.
- [x] Connect Admin Users page to `GET /accounts`.
- [x] Connect Admin user detail/read action to `GET /accounts/:id`.
- [x] Connect Admin ban action to `PATCH /accounts/:accountId/ban`.
- [x] Implement or defer Admin create account UI using `POST /accounts`.
- [x] Add or document Admin subject management workflow.
- [x] Add tests for Admin API clients and critical UI states.
- [x] Add filter accounts by createdDate, default will show the newest account created
- [x] Admin only create moderator account, and it will be default status is `ACTIVE`
- [x] On UI, banned users will hile ban action
- [x] Add bussiness rule admin account can not be banned and admin account will hide from user account management list
- [x] Hide ID from account management, Last Login Date
- [x] Refactor admin-only API controller ownership into `AdminModule`.
- [x] Add backend dashboard summary endpoint at `GET /api/v1/admin/dashboard`.
- [x] Connect Web Admin dashboard summary cards to `GET /api/v1/admin/dashboard`.
- [x] Make Admin settings persistence explicitly deferred instead of reporting fake saves.

### Admin Subject Management Workflow

For the current Admin MVP hardening pass, subject management is API-only.

- Admin can create a subject with `POST /api/v1/subjects`.
- Admin can update a subject with `PATCH /api/v1/subjects/:id`.
- Admin can delete a subject with `DELETE /api/v1/subjects/:id`.
- Subject listing and detail remain public through `GET /api/v1/subjects` and `GET /api/v1/subjects/:id`.
- The Web Admin subject-management UI is deferred until after the users page is stable against real account APIs.

### Admin API Boundary

The API now has a dedicated `AdminModule` for admin-only controller ownership:

- Admin account create/list/detail/ban handlers are owned by `AdminModule`.
- Admin subject create/update/delete handlers are owned by `AdminModule`.
- Route URLs remain backward compatible:
  - `/api/v1/accounts`
  - `/api/v1/subjects`
- User self-service account update/delete remains in `AccountsController`.
- Subject read routes remain in `SubjectsController`.

## Priority 4 - Auth Client Completion

- [x] Align Web signin/refresh/logout with the chosen token strategy.
- [ ] Ensure Web verify-email token route posts `{ token }` to `/auth/verify-email`.
- [ ] Ensure Web resend verification uses `/auth/resend-verification-email` with the pending verification cookie/JWT.
- [x] Mobile: add reset-password flow for reset-token links.
- [x] Mobile: add refresh-token flow and token persistence strategy.
- [ ] Mobile: define and implement resend verification contract for pending verification users.
- [x] Add regression tests for Web auth helpers and Mobile auth service.

## Priority 5 - Prepare Phase 5 File Upload

Do not start full implementation until Phase 4 is complete.

- [ ] Choose storage provider and document required env variables.
- [ ] Decide supported MIME types and max file size.
- [ ] Add upload endpoint design:
  - multipart handling
  - auth requirements
  - storage response mapping
  - metadata creation
- [ ] Decide download endpoint behavior and permission checks.
- [ ] Decide whether `downloadCount` and/or `viewCount` belongs in `documents`.

## Priority 6 - Prepare AI/RAG Phases

Do not start implementation until file upload and document lifecycle are stable.

- [ ] Decide where extracted text is stored.
- [ ] Decide chunking and embedding strategy.
- [ ] Decide vector store/provider.
- [ ] Design summary/keywords persistence.
- [ ] Design chat session/message schema.
- [ ] Design quiz schema if quiz history should persist.
- [ ] Define duplicate detection threshold and moderator warning UX.

## Recommended Next Sprint

1. Complete Web verify-email and resend-verification flows.
2. Define Mobile resend verification contract for pending verification users.
3. Evaluate refresh-token cookie Web auth contract as a separate backend/client cleanup.
4. Define Admin settings backend contract if system configuration becomes part of MVP.
5. Run focused API/Web/Mobile auth regression tests.
